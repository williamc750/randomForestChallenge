## üéØ Note on Python Usage

You have not been coached through setting up a Python environment.  **If using Python** You will need to set up a Python environment and install the necessary packages to run this code - takes about 15 minutes; see [https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html](https://quarto.org/docs/projects/virtual-environments.html).  Alternatively, delete the Python code and only leave the remaining R code that is provided.  You can see the executed Python output at my GitHub pages site: [https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/](https://flyaflya.github.io/randomForestChallenge/).

## The Problem: Can Many Weak Learners Beat One Strong Learner?

**Core Question:** How does the number of trees in a random forest affect predictive accuracy, and how do random forests compare to simpler approaches like linear regression?

**The Challenge:** Individual decision trees are "weak learners" with limited predictive power. Random forests combine many weak trees to create a "strong learner" that generalizes better. But how many trees do we need? Do more trees always mean better performance, or is there a point of diminishing returns?

**Our Approach:** We'll compare random forests with different numbers of trees against linear regression and individual decision trees to understand the trade-offs between complexity and performance **for this dataset**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è AI Partnership Required

This challenge pushes boundaries intentionally. You'll tackle problems that normally require weeks of study, but with Cursor AI as your partner (and your brain keeping it honest), you can accomplish more than you thought possible.

**The new reality:** The four stages of competence are Ignorance ‚Üí Awareness ‚Üí Learning ‚Üí Mastery. AI lets us produce Mastery-level work while operating primarily in the Awareness stage. I focus on awareness training, you leverage AI for execution, and together we create outputs that used to require years of dedicated study.

## Data and Methodology

We analyze the Ames Housing dataset, which contains detailed information about residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. This dataset is ideal for our analysis because:

- **Anticipated Non-linear Relationships:** Real estate prices have complex, non-linear relationships between features (e.g., square footage in wealthy vs. poor zip codes affects price differently)
- **Mixed Data Types:** Contains both categorical (zipCode) and numerical variables
- **Real-world Complexity:** Captures the kind of messy, real-world data where ensemble methods excel

Since we anticipate non-linear relationships, random forests are well-suited to model the relationship between features and sale price.

## Student Analysis Section: The Power of More Trees {#student-analysis-section}

**Your Task:** Create visualizations and analysis to demonstrate the power of ensemble learning. You'll need to create three key components:

### 1. The Power of More Trees Visualization

**Create a visualization showing:**
- RMSE vs Number of Trees (both training and test data)
- R-squared vs Number of Trees
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

**Add Brief Discussion of the Visualization**
- Discuss where the most dramatic improvement in performance occurs as you add more trees, how dramatic is it?
- Discuss diminishing returns as you add more trees

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Visualization Requirements

Create two plots:
1. **RMSE Plot:** Show how RMSE decreases with more trees (both training and test)
2. **R-squared Plot:** Show how R-squared increases with more trees

Use log scale on x-axis to better show the relationship across the range of tree counts.

```{r}
#| label: power-of-trees-visualization
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| fig-width: 12
#| fig-height: 6

# Create performance data for visualization
performance_viz <- data.frame(
  Trees = c(1, 5, 25, 100, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000),
  RMSE_Test = c(rmse_1_test, rmse_5_test, rmse_25_test, rmse_100_test, rmse_500_test, rmse_1000_test, rmse_2000_test, rmse_5000_test),
  RMSE_Train = c(rmse_1_train, rmse_5_train, rmse_25_train, rmse_100_train, rmse_500_train, rmse_1000_train, rmse_2000_train, rmse_5000_train),
  R_squared = c(r2_1, r2_5, r2_25, r2_100, r2_500, r2_1000, r2_2000, r2_5000)
)

# Create side-by-side plots
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 4, 2) + 0.1)

# Plot 1: RMSE vs Number of Trees
plot(performance_viz$Trees, performance_viz$RMSE_Test, 
     type = "b", pch = 19, col = "red", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Number of Trees (log scale)", ylab = "RMSE",
     main = "RMSE vs Number of Trees",
     log = "x", xaxt = "n", ylim = range(c(performance_viz$RMSE_Test, performance_viz$RMSE_Train)))

lines(performance_viz$Trees, performance_viz$RMSE_Train, 
      type = "b", pch = 17, col = "blue", lwd = 2)

# Add custom x-axis with log scale
axis(1, at = performance_viz$Trees, labels = performance_viz$Trees)

legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Test Data", "Training Data"), 
       col = c("red", "blue"), 
       pch = c(19, 17), 
       lwd = 2,
       bty = "n")

# Plot 2: R-squared vs Number of Trees
plot(performance_viz$Trees, performance_viz$R_squared, 
     type = "b", pch = 19, col = "darkgreen", lwd = 2,
     xlab = "Number of Trees (log scale)", ylab = "R-squared",
     main = "R-squared vs Number of Trees",
     log = "x", xaxt = "n", ylim = c(0, 1))

# Add custom x-axis with log scale
axis(1, at = performance_viz$Trees, labels = performance_viz$Trees)

# Add horizontal line at R-squared = 0.8 for reference
abline(h = 0.8, col = "gray", lty = 2)

# Reset plotting parameters
par(mfrow = c(1, 1))
```

**Brief Discussion of the Visualization**

The most dramatic improvements in performance occurs between 1 and 5 trees. The improvement for R-squared past 5 trees is not as dramataic and starts to taper off. For RMSE, there is a more gradual improvement between 5 and 25 trees. After 25 trees, the imporvement in RMSE tapers off as well. The returns for both metrics slowly starts to diminish after 25 trees. 

:::

### 2. Overfitting Visualization and Analysis

**Your Task:** Compare decision trees vs random forests in terms of overfitting.

**Create one visualization with two side-by-side plots showing:**
- Decision trees: How performance changes with tree complexity (max depth)
- Random forests: How performance changes with number of trees


**Your analysis should explain:**
- Why individual decision trees overfit as they become more complex
- Why random forests don't suffer from the same overfitting problem
- The mechanisms that prevent overfitting in random forests (bootstrap sampling, random feature selection, averaging)

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Overfitting Analysis Requirements

Create a side-by-side comparison showing:
1. **Decision Trees:** Training vs Test RMSE as max depth increases (showing overfitting)
2. **Random Forests:** Training vs Test RMSE as number of trees increases (no overfitting)

- Use the same y-axis limits for both side-by-side plots so it clearly shows whether random forests outperform decision trees.
- Do not `echo` the code that creates the visualization

  # Build decision tree with specific max depth

```

**Brief Discussion of the Visualization**
In the visualization, we can see that the decision trees suffer from overfitting as the max depth increases. The training RMSE decreases as the max depth increases, while the test RMSE increases. This demonstrates the model is being too accustomed to the training data and is not generalizing well to the test data.

The random forests do not suffer from the same overfitting problem. The training RMSE and test RMSE are relatively stable across the range of tree counts. This demonstrates the random forest is not being too accustomed to the training data and is generalizing well to the test data.

Decision trees overfit as they become more complex because they split the data based on feature values to minimize error. Eventually, the tree becomes too complex and will overfit to the training data because it stats splitting on miniscule differences in the data.

Random forests don‚Äôt suffer from the same overfitting problem because the individual trees are built independently on different bootstrap samples of the data and use random subsets of features when splitting. This randomness reduces the correlation between trees, so when their predictions are averaged, the overall model becomes more stable and less prone to overfitting.

### 3. Linear Regression vs Random Forest Comparison

**Your Task:** Compare random forests to linear regression baseline.

**Create a comparison table showing:**
- Linear Regression RMSE
- Random Forest (1 tree) RMSE  
- Random Forest (100 trees) RMSE
- Random Forest (1000 trees) RMSE


**Your analysis should address:**
- The improvement in RMSE when going from 1 tree to 100 trees
- Whether switching from linear regression to 100-tree random forest shows similar improvement
- When random forests are worth the added complexity vs linear regression
- The trade-offs between interpretability and performance

::: {.callout-important}
## üìä Comparison Requirements

Create a clear table comparing:

- Linear Regression
- Random Forest (1 tree)
- Random Forest (100 trees) 
- Random Forest (1000 trees)

Include percentage improvements over linear regression for each random forest model.

## üìä What You're Really Being Graded On

**This is an investigative report, not a coding exercise.** You're analyzing random forest models and reporting your findings like a professional analyst would. Think of this as a brief you'd write for a client or manager about the power of ensemble learning and when to use random forests vs simpler approaches.

**What makes a great report:**

- **Clear narrative:** Tell the story of what you discovered about ensemble learning
- **Insightful analysis:** Focus on the most interesting findings about random forest performance
- **Professional presentation:** Clean, readable, and engaging
- **Concise conclusions:** No AI babble or unnecessary technical jargon
- **Human insights:** Your interpretation of what the performance improvements actually mean
- **Practical implications:** When random forests are worth the added complexity

**What we're looking for:** A compelling 2-3 minute read that demonstrates both the power of ensemble learning and the importance of choosing the right tool for the job.
